# ðŸª… Self-learning Pixi.js
I came across PHQ and was captivated by their creative works (http://www.phantom.land/). Their projects inspired me to dive into PixiJS! 
I have a huge interest in creative and aesthetic design, and I believe that technology, combined with innovative design, can bring exceptional ideas to life.
<br />
## What is Pixi.js?
PixiJS is a 2D rendering engine for the web, designed to create stunning, high-performance interactive graphics and animations. Built with WebGL and HTML5, 
itâ€™s widely used for games, art, and other visually rich experiences. It's lightweight, fast, and incredibly versatile, making it a favourite for creative developers.

## Things I learned
- Starting with documentation: The first step in learning any new technology is exploring its official documentation. I followed the Getting Started guide to create a simple PixiJS application using just JavaScript in an HTML file.
- Customizing the playground example: Using the PixiJS playground as a base, I customized it by choosing a PNG image that matched my taste and added an extra animation for a bouncing effect. It was a fun way to explore and tweak the basics.
- Understanding the basics: I gained foundational knowledge about how PixiJS works and its core components, including:
    - Sprite: The visual representation of an image or graphic.
    - Container: A way to group and organize multiple elements on the stage.
- Working with the ticker: I learned how to use the ticker to handle frame-by-frame updates and create smooth animations.
